#abstract: Fantasy Premier League (https://fantasy.premierleague.com) is one of the worlds most popular online fantasy sports games with ~7 million players. During the 2018-19 season we undertook a large data scraping exercise to obtain data describing the manager's selections over the year, along with a number of other statistics on the actual footballers upon which the game is based. <p>In this talk we will firstly introduce our dataset before proceeding to discuss the dynamics and actions of the games managers via a number of statistical tools and visualizations obtained through R and the tidyverse, with the hope of determining whether the top (fantasy) mangers earn their title through certain skills and if so what skills?
